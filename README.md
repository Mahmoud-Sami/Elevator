# Elevator Controller
This project simulates Elevator Controller using Java and Esper, the project is done as university coursework project in the Real Time systems - (RTS) module

## Prerequisites  
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/) - Programming language.
* [Esper](http://www.espertech.com/esper/) - Language, compiler and runtime that enables rapid real time development by offering an Event Processing Language (EPL) that implements and extends the SQL-standard and enables rich expressions over events and time.
* [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/) - Java-based integrated development environment (IDE).

## Graphical User Interface - Java Swing
